The screengrabber is built upon example code from Jeffrey Richter's Win32 Q&A column 
in Microsoft Systems Journal April 1995 — Vol 10 No 4. 
The article describes the idea of using a journal hook to keep receiving mouse messages. 
I used it to allow the screengrabber to receive mouse messages no matter the window it is hovering above.
Also many thanks to Joe C Hecht, Damon Chandler and others in the Borland newsgroups for code snippets that showed me how to deal with paletted displays.
