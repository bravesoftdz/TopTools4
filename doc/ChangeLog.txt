Jan-25-03 Loupe:          Completely rewritten, can now be resized and can zoom in single steps between 1x and 20x.
                          Added a dot-grid and re-added the outlined crosshairs (on request of Pieter Duyves)

Apr-10-02 Info:           Added a color preview box and HSV display

Apr-06-02 Ruler:          Started experimenting with a full screen trackline. It turned out to be disturbing the screen, so I put it on "Hold"

Jan-16-02 Screengrabber:  Save to file now behaves correctly when no filename extension is specified.

Feb-13-02 released 2.4.3

Feb-13-02 Screengrabber:  Fixed a bug that prevented the snapshot from being saved when the selection was not made from top-left to bottom-right.

Jan-25-02 Ruler:          The ruler now toggles orientation when middle mouse button clicked (provided this event is mapped to 'middle button' in the Mouse settings of the Control Panel).

Jan-07-02 Screengrabber:  Selecting Cancel in the "Save to File" dialog now cancels the entire capture operation.

Jan-06-02 released 2.4.2
Jan-06-02 TopTools:       Tray icon now gets restored after a crash of Windows Explorer.

Nov-21-01 Info Window:    Pressing Ctrl-C now copies the current pixel color to the clipboard in #RRGGBB webcolor format.
                          Think I finally managed to get the stay-on-top feature stable...
                          Need to rethink the trayicon double-click and minimize logic

Aug-08-01 TopTools:       Major implementation changes, all tools are now derived from TToolForm that handles all common functionality.
                          The Ruler and the Mainwindow still need to be done..

Jul-18-01 Base Converter: Made editing the binary value a bit more practical and intuitive by inhibiting the redelimit action in case of a delete or backspace keypress
                          Made the decimal display unsigned.

Jul-12-01 Ruler:          Removed the 'Toggle ruler orientation by doubleclicking' feature
                          Reacting on a doubleclick event to change ruler
                          orientation turned out to be impossible without resorting to exotic workarounds
                          Orientation can now be toggled with the numeric '/' key

May-30-01 About:          Revamped the About dialogbox, it now shows the actual
                          build number and date.
                          Also added a hyperlink to the TopTools homepage and
                          changed the logo.

May-16-01 Ruler:          The ruler now toggles orientation when double clicked.

Feb-10-01 TopTools:       Now works correctly with multiple monitors.

Dec-06-00 TopTools:       Now minimizes to system tray.
                          Moved most event handling to ActionModule.
                          Completely reimplemented screengrabber, many thanks
                          to Joe C Hecht, Damon Chandler and the Borland
                          newsgroups.

Nov-17-00 Info Window:    Now runs in it's own window.

Oct-02-00 Screen Grabber: Fixed bug that made "Save as File" save in BMP-format
                          regardless of chosen file extension. JPG and GIF are
                          now saved properly.
                          Also fixed a bug in the screen update sequence after
                          a selection is made.
                          Noted again that the screengrabber code needs some
                          serious cleanup.

Aug-01-00 Base Converter: Added delimiters in binary representation.
                          Disabled right-click menu to prevent pasting invalid
                          input into the edit boxes.
                          Todo: derive a specific TFilterPasteEdit and override
                          the WM_PASTE command handler to do specific filtering.
