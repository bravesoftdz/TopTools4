            Introduction
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            I developed TopTools through the years as I was confronted with questions like:
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            </p>
            <ul class="text">
              <li>
                How can I get a closer look at this icon?
              </li>
              <li>
                How many pixels should I move this image to align with the rest?
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the height of this image?
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the RGB value of this pixel?
              </li>
              <li>
                How can I get this part of the screen on the clipboard?
              </li>
              <li>
                What was the ASCII value of this character again?
              </li>
              <li>
                What is 10110110 in hexadecimal?
              </li>
              <li>
                How can I quickly resize this window to 640x480

            Features
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            <u>General</u> <br>
            All tool windows have a right-click popup menu, most of them are self-explanatory.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Ruler</u> <br>
            The ruler measures screen objects in pixel units. It has a floating position
            indicator that follows the mouse pointer. The mouse pointer has a line shape
            that flips when moved across the center of the ruler, in this way both sides of
            the ruler can be used. The ruler orientation can be toggled through the popup
            menu or by pressing the numeric '/' key. It can be moved with the arrow keys or
            by dragging it with the mouse.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            <br>
            <br>
            <img style="width: 631px; height: 433px;" alt="Ruler and Loupe"
       src="ruler_loupe.gif"><br>
            <u>Loupe</u> <br>
            The loupe displays an enlarged view of the area around the mouse pointer,
            optionally a crosshair can be shown to indicate the exact hotspot location. The
            zoom factor can be adjusted between 1 and 20 times either through the popup menu
            or by pressing the numeric '+' and '-' keys. The loupeview can be frozen by
            hitting the spacebar. <br>
            <br>
            <img style="width: 160px; height: 127px;" alt="Info Window"
       src="info.png" align="right"><u>Info</u> <br>
            The info window displays the color of the pixel under the mouse hotspot in both
            RGB and #webcolor notation. Besides it shows the current mouseposition in screen
            coordinates. <br>
<!--             <span class="new">  -->
<!--             new                 -->
<!--             </span>             -->
            By pressing 'Ctrl-C' or a user definable hotkey, the current color is copied to
            the clipboard in RRGGBB format. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text">

            alt="Base Converter Window" src="baseconv.png" align="right"><u>Base Converter</u>
            <br>
            The base converter is a tiny calculator that converts between hexadecimal,
            decimal and binary. It can also be used to find the ASCII value of printable
            characters. <br>
            <br>
            <u>Screen grabber</u> <br>
            <img src="grabber.png" align="right">
            The screen grabber captures a portion of the screen, it shows a sizable,
            transparent window that can be accurately positioned by using the mouse or the
            keyboard. <br>
            Screen-capture can be activated with a global hotkey. <br>
            Grabbed View can be opened in a window, saved to file, copied to clipboard or
            printed. <br>
            Autosave features make it easy to capture a sequence of views with a minimum
            of keystrokes.

            History
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            TopTools was born when I was using a screen-magnifier and a screen-ruler at the
            same time and was annoyed by the fact that the two didn't cooperate: <br>
            The magnifier showed the portion of the screen that is left of and above the
            hotspot of the mouse pointer instead of a portion <em>around</em> the hotspot.
            So when the magnifier was used together with the ruler, one would see either a
            close-up of the ruler, or a close-up of what was really to be measured, but with
            the ruler out of sight. The ruler was actually quite good, but it came up with
            annoying shareware nag-boxes and I thought the price was a bit high for such a
            simple utility, so I decided to create my own. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Later I added some other little utilities, like the base-converter and the color-picker.
            <br>
            Screen capture was the latest addition to the tools. <br>
            <br>
            The initial version was developed using Borland C++ 5.0 and the Object Windows
            Library. Later versions were adapted to and maintained with Borland C++Builder 3,
            4 and 5.

            Version history

            <p class="subtitle">
            version 3.0:
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            </p>
            <ul class="text">
              <li>
                Loupe <br>
                I rewrote the loupe from scratch, attempts to make it sizable made clear this
                was the only sane option. <br>
                It is sizable now and I added a tool bar. <br>
                On machines running Windows 2000 or Windows XP, the loupe window sits on it's
                own layer, so it doesn't show up in it's own view, it is fully transparent to
                itself ;). <br>
                Magnification can now be any discrete value between 1 and 20. <br>
                The view can be frozen (detached from mouse movement) so it is possible to keep
                the magnified view of a screen part in focus. The focus point of the view can be
                moved by dragging it with the mouse. <br>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Screen capture <br>
                The screen grabber no longer freezes the screen during a capture session. <br>
                It now supports PNG format in saving snapshots. <br>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Global hotkey<br>
                Version 2.41 added functionality to the info window so that pressing Ctrl-C
                would copy the current color in #ABCDEF webcolor format to the clipboard, but
                this only works when one of the TopTools windows has the keyboard focus.<br>
                The global hotkey works regardless of which window (or even what desktop) is
                active, it acts global for the entire machine.<br>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Options dialog<br>
                The hotkey needed a way to be configured, so I added this dialog.<br>
                The way a color is copied to the clipboard can also be configured, a leading '#'
                is annoying in Photoshop, it prefers ABCDEF (or it gives you #ABCDE), but when
                editing HTML it is more convenient to have a '#' prefix and have surrounding
                quotes ("#ABCDEF"). These format settings apply to both the hotkey action and
                the classic Ctrl-C action (which still works).<br>
                Finally I added an option to start with Windows and a way to adjust the length
                of the ruler. <br>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                General<br>
                I spent a lot of time playing with the appearance of the tools.<br>
                All tool windows now have a "snap to screen border" feature. You can override
                this behavior by holding down the Ctrl key while moving the window. <br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="subtitle">

            <ul class="text">
              <li>
                Fixed two bugs in the Screen-grabber:<br>
                The snapshot was only saved when the selection was made from top-left to bottom-right,
                classic example of sloppy programming...<br>
                Selecting Cancel in the "Save to File" dialog now cancels the entire capture
                operation.
              </li>
              <li>
                The ruler orientation can now be toggled with the middle mouse button (provided
                this event is mapped to 'middle button' in the Mouse settings of the Control
                Panel).

                interfered with the singleclick action (start a drag operation). Orientation can
                now be toggled with the '/' key on the numeric keypad.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fixed a bug in the loupe-magnification (this one was introduced with version 2.3).
              </li>
              <li>
                Removed the grid option from the loupe, it served no practical purpose.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fixed a bug in the binary field of the baseconverter that made the caret jump to
                the left with every digit entered.
              </li>
              <li>
                Revamped the "About..." dialog box, it now shows the actual build number and
                date. Also added a hyperlink to the TopTools homepage and changed the logo.
