    TopTools was born when I was using a screen-magnifier and a screen-ruler at the
    same time and was annoyed by the fact that the two didn't cooperate:
    <p>
    The magnifier showed the portion of the screen that is left of and above the
    hotspot of the mouse pointer instead of a portion <em>around</em> the hotspot.
    <p>
    So when the magnifier was used together with the ruler, one would see either a
    close-up of the ruler, or a close-up of what was really to be measured, but with
    the ruler out of sight.
    <p>
    The ruler was actually quite good, but it came up with annoying shareware nag-boxes
    and I thought the price was a bit high for such a simple utility, so I decided
    to create my own.
    <p>
    Later I added some other little utilities, like the base-converter and the color-picker.
    <p>
    Screen capture was the latest addition to the tools. <br>
