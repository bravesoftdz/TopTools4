## Hotkeys

Keyboard shortcuts like those listed above only work when one of the TopTools
windows has keyboard focus (when TopTools is the active application).

Sometimes it is useful to control a tool while another application has
focus. You might be viewing a page in the webbrowser and needing a
close-up view, or you would like to save or print a screenshot.

For these situations you can define a (system-wide) hotkey for certain operations.

Currently hotkeys can be defined for the following operations:

  * Copy color to clipboard (Info)
  * Zoom In (Loupe)
  * Zoom Out (Loupe)
  * Start Screen-capture (Screen-grabber)
  * Show/hide active toolwindow(s) (Tray Icon)

Hotkeys can be defined in the Options dialogbox, not all key combinations are valid,
some are reserved by Windows and some may be already taken by other running applications.

## Startup options

TopTools can run in three modes:

* Portable mode:
No settings are saved, this is the default mode.

* Registry mode:
Settings will be stored in the Windows Registry.

* Ini-file mode:
Settings will be saved in a file with the '.ini' extension.

When Toptools is started, it tries to figure out which mode it is running
in, the heuristics used are as follows:

* If there are commandline arguments (see below):
use indicated mode.

* Else if a file called "TopTools4.ini" is found:
use Ini-file mode.

* Else if a registry key is found (HKCU\\Software\\TopTools 4):
use Registry mode.

* Otherwise use Portable mode.

----------|----------|----------|----------
&nbsp;    | **-p**   |&nbsp;    | use Portable mode
&nbsp;    | **-r**   |&nbsp;    | use Registry mode
&nbsp;    | **-i&nbsp;[filepath.ini]** |&nbsp;    | use Ini-file mode, optionally use 'filepath.ini' as ini-file.
