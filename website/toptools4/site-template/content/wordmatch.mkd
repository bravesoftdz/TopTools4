Little helper in solving letter-puzzles (cryptograms etc.)

The program looks for a file named "wordlist.dat" in it's startup directory.
You'll have to find/create your own wordlist, any list of words will do,
provided it contains only 7-bit ASCII characters.

The words you'd like to match might be in another language than Dutch
The wordlist I use for this program

I am not sure where I got it, if anyone feels I stole their words, please let me know.
