Dear TopTools user,

TopTools 4.0 is now available for download from:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~wij/toptools/toptools4.html

New in version 4.0:

Portable App
TopTools is now "portable", so you can run it from a USB-stick etc. 
Contrary to TopTools 3, version 4 saves settings only if you ask it to, 
either in the registry or in an .ini file.

No installer
Since TopTools doesn't depend on external libraries or frameworks, there 
is no (and never really was any) reason for it to be "installed", just 
unzip the exe and run it.

Main window
* Minimize to system tray is now optional.
* Added Options button.

Screengrabber
* Grabbed view can now be printed.
* Completely rewritten for Vista, but won't work on Win95/98 ..
* Grab-screen now shows a sizable, transparent window that can be 
accurately positioned by using the mouse or the keyboard.
* Screen-capture can be activated with global hotkey.
* Grabbed View can be opened in a window, saved to file, copied to 
clipboard or printed.
* New Autosave features make it easy to capture a sequence of views with 
a minimum of keystrokes.

Info
* Left-click and drag from the Info-window to display mouse coordinates 
relative to the window above which the mouse is hovering (instead of 
relative to the top-left of the desktop).

Loupe
* Locked View can now be copied, saved or printed.

Ruler
* Can now be made transparent (not on Win95/98).

Options dialog
* Many new options


Regards,
Willem Jongman.
